      blockers: []
      notes: "Modular engine in place. Added feature calculators (schedule/injury/role/trend/team strength) with safe defaults, wired into prediction context, and implemented heuristic FBRef parsing for fixtures/table (Europe mapping still TODO)."

    next_steps:
      immediate: "Harden B2 feature inputs (Europe flags/PPG via FBRef) and keep scoring stable."
      upcoming:
        - "Enrich schedule data and role/injury signals once source data is available."
        - "Outline datasets/ML toggle strategy for B6/B7 and Monte Carlo placeholder for B8."
